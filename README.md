#Super Duo

Here is the Project 3 of Udacity Android Nanodegree program - Super Duo.

Super Duo project was a about enhancing two apps in order to make them production ready. 
It consists of 2 apps: _Football Scores_ and _Alexandria_.
The job was to edit mostly functional apps and implement changes that will make each app production ready. The work included ensuring errors were handled gracefully, building a widget for the home screen, 
support for screen readers, optimizations for localization, and barcode scanning via a library.

The project was evaluated by Udacity reviewers and was graded as _"Exceeds Specifications"_.

## 1. Football Scores

An app that tracks current and future football matches

## 2. Alexandria

A book list and barcode scanner app.
